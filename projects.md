### EZEE Pick Robotic Arm 

![EZEE](/images/EZPRA.jpg)

The grab and pick industry like vineyards employ manual labor to pick their grapes. Grapes are susceptible to pests and diseases therefore pesticides are used to protect the product until it can be picked. There is growing evidence that the pesticides used to protect the grapes are causing health problems and hazardous work environments for the workers.

To reduce the exposure of humans to pesticides that can cause long term health problems, an Arduino controlled robotic arm was developed and distributed to the workers in the grab and pick industry. The Arduino microcontroller is a readily available technology that can be easily acquired, and the material choice for the body and claw of the robot is a 3D printed PLA filament which is also easily accessible and low cost.

### Rain Flow Filter 

Developed a sustainable micro water filter with the utilization of rainwater in order to effectively and efficiently provide clean water to developing countries. Through the manufacturing of the Rain Flow Filter, clean water was easily accessed by millions of people who regularly encountered water scarcity.  

 

The innerworkings of the micro water filter incorporates three major steps: 

  1. The addition of a coagulant of aluminum sulfate to precipitate dissolved impurities 

  2. A coal, sand, and gravel bed to catch unwanted particles 

  3. The addition of chlorine to kill bacteria and prevent water-born illnesses
